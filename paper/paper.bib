The latter factor may vary across regions of the brain as a result of variations in field homogeneity. Previous measurements of the signal change with echo time have generally employed relatively slow multi-echo techniques, which may be sensitive to movement and habituation effects. Here a fast T measurement technique, involving the generation of six low-resolution echo planar images from a single FID, is described, and its use in the evaluation of the optimum echo time for visual, motor, and auditory fMRI experiments at 3.0 T is outlined.

Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each dataset, building upon a large inventory of available tools. The complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances in acquisition and processing. We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for fMRI data. fMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing without manual intervention. By introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative integration framework for software testing, we show that fMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality results on a diverse fMRI data collection. Additionally, fMRIPrep introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than observed with commonly used preprocessing tools. fMRIPrep equips neuroscientists with an easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing workflow, which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretability of results.},

Visual inspection is subjective and impractical for large scale datasets. Although automated quality assessments have been demonstrated on single-site datasets, it is unclear that solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites. Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC), a tool for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset (17 sites, N = 1102). We perform model selection evaluating different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of 76\%{$\pm$}13\% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2 sites, N = 265) also obtaining a 76\% accuracy. Even though the performance of the trained classifier is statistically above chance, we show that it is susceptible to site effects and unable to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site variability. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for a more objective quality assessment of neuroimaging data, and to enable the analysis of extremely large and multi-site samples.},

Multiecho sampling improves sensitivity in areas where single-echo-EPI suffers from dropouts. However, It requires in-plane acceleration to reduce the echo train length, limiting the slice acceleration factor and the temporal and spatial resolution Data were acquired for both protocols in two sessions 24\,h apart using an adapted color-word interference Stroop task. Besides protocol comparison statistically, we performed test\textendash retest reliability across sessions for different protocols and denoising methods. We evaluated the sensitivity of two different echo-combination strategies for MBME-EPI. We examined the performance of three different data denoising approaches: ``Standard,'' ``AROMA,'' and ``FIX'' for MB and MBME, and assessed whether a specific method is preferable. We consider using an appropriate autoregressive model order within the general linear model framework to correct TR differences between the protocols. The comparison between protocols and denoising methods showed at group level significantly higher mean z-scores and the number of active voxels for MBME in the motor, subcortical and medial frontal cortices. When comparing different echo combinations, our results suggest that a contrast-to-noise ratio weighted echo combination improves sensitivity in MBME compared to simple echo-summation. This study indicates that MBME can be a preferred protocol in task fMRI at spatial resolution ({$\geq$}2\,mm), primarily in medial prefrontal and subcortical areas., In summary, we found that multiband multiecho (MBME) and MB give a comparable performance in most brain regions with this comparison study. In the regions with dropouts and susceptibility induced inhomogeneity, MBME performed somewhat better at the group level. The results showed that the difference between sequences is more significant than between different denoising (FIX and AROMA) strategies at the group level, highlighting the importance of considering an optimized sequence before data collection. For MBME, choosing an optimal echo combination can influence the sensitivity at the group-level analysis.},

  abstract = {Multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis is often concerned with determining whether there exists a significant population-wide `activation' in a comparison between two or more conditions. Typically this is assessed by testing the average value of a contrast of parameter estimates (COPE) against zero in a general linear model (GLM) analysis. In this work we investigate several aspects of this type of analysis. First, we study the effects of sample size on the sensitivity and reliability of the group analysis, allowing us to evaluate the ability of small sampled studies to effectively capture population-level effects of interest. Second, we assess the difference in sensitivity and reliability when using volumetric or surface based data. Third, we investigate potential biases in estimating effect sizes as a function of sample size. To perform this analysis we utilize the task-based fMRI data from the 500-subject release from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We treat the complete collection of subjects (N = 491) as our population of interest, and perform a single-subject analysis on each subject in the population. We investigate the ability to recover population level effects using a subset of the population and standard analytical techniques. Our study shows that sample sizes of 40 are generally able to detect regions with high effect sizes (Cohen's d {$>$} 0.8), while sample sizes closer to 80 are required to reliably recover regions with medium effect sizes (0.5 {$<$} d {$<$} 0.8). We find little difference in results when using volumetric or surface based data with respect to standard mass-univariate group analysis. Finally, we conclude that special care is needed when estimating effect sizes, particularly for small sample sizes.},

  abstract = {The study of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data has greatly benefitted from the development of sophisticated and efficient algorithms aimed at automating and optimizing the analysis of brain data. We address, in the context of the segmentation of brain from non-brain tissue (i.e., brain extraction, also known as skull-stripping), the tension between the increased theoretical and clinical interest in patient data, and the difficulty of conventional algorithms to function optimally in the presence of gross brain pathology. Indeed, because of the reliance of many algorithms on priors derived from healthy volunteers, images with gross pathology can severely affect their ability to correctly trace the boundaries between brain and non-brain tissue, potentially biasing subsequent analysis. We describe and make available an optimized brain extraction script for the pathological brain (optiBET) robust to the presence of pathology. Rather than attempting to trace the boundary between tissues, optiBET performs brain extraction by (i) calculating an initial approximate brain extraction; (ii) employing linear and non-linear registration to project the approximate extraction into the MNI template space; (iii) back-projecting a standard brain-only mask from template space to the subject's original space; and (iv) employing the back-projected brain-only mask to mask-out non-brain tissue. The script results in up to 94\% improvement of the quality of extractions over those obtained with conventional software across a large set of severely pathological brains. Since optiBET makes use of freely available algorithms included in FSL, it should be readily employable by anyone having access to such tools.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in MRI receiver and coil technologies have significantly improved image signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and thus temporal SNR (TSNR). These gains in SNR and TSNR have allowed the detection of fMRI signal changes at higher spatial resolution and therefore have increased the potential to localize small brain structures such as cortical layers and columns. The majority of current fMRI processing strategies employ multi-subject averaging and therefore require spatial smoothing and normalization, effectively negating these gains in spatial resolution higher than about 10~mm3. Reliable detection of activation in single subjects at high resolution is becoming a more common desire among fMRI researchers who are interested in comparing individuals rather than populations. Since TSNR decreases with voxel volume, detection of activation at higher resolutions requires longer scan durations. The relationship between TSNR, voxel volume and detectability is highly non-linear. In this study, the relationship between TSNR and the necessary fMRI scan duration required to obtain significant results at varying P values is determined both experimentally and theoretically. The results demonstrate that, with a TSNR of 50, detection of activation of above 2\% requires at most 350 scan volumes (when steps are taken to remove the influence of physiological noise from the data). Importantly, these results also demonstrate that, for activation magnitude on the order of 1\%, the scan duration required is more sensitive to the TSNR level than at 2\%. This study showed that with voxel volumes of {$\sim$}10~mm3 at 3~T, and a corresponding TSNR of {$\sim$}50, the required number of time points that guarantees detection of signal changes of 1\% is about 860, but if TSNR increases by only 20\%, the time for detection decreases by more than 30\%. More than just being an exercise in numbers, these results imply that imaging of columnar resolution (effect size=1\% and assuming a TR of 1~s) at 3~T will require either 10~min for a TSNR of 60 or 40~min for a TSNR of 30. The implication is that at these resolutions, TSNR is likely to be critical for determining success or failure of an experiment.},

Multiband (MB) acceleration leads to a higher temporal resolution but also leads to spatially heterogeneous noise amplification, suggesting the costs may be greater in areas such as the subcortex. We evaluate MB factors of 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12 with 2 mm isotropic voxels, and additionally 2 mm and 3.3 mm single-band acquisitions, on a 32-channel head coil. Noise amplification was greater in deeper brain regions, including subcortical regions. Correlations were attenuated by noise amplification, which resulted in spatially varying biases that were more severe at higher MB factors. Temporal filtering decreased spatial biases in correlations due to noise amplification, but also tended to decrease effect sizes. In seed-based correlation maps, left-right putamen connectivity and thalamo-motor connectivity were highest in the single-band 3.3 mm protocol. In correlation matrices, MB 4, 6, and 8 had a greater number of significant correlations than the other acquisitions (both with and without temporal filtering). We recommend single-band 3.3 mm for seed-based subcortical analyses, and MB 4 provides a reasonable balance for studies analyzing both seed-based correlation maps and connectivity matrices. In multiband studies including secondary analyses of large-scale datasets, we recommend reporting effect sizes or test statistics instead of correlations. If correlations are reported, temporal filtering (or another method for thermal noise removal) should be used. The Emory Multiband Dataset is available on OpenNeuro.},

We present two fMRI studies comparing SENSE single-shot (ssh) echo planar imaging (EPI) at acceleration factors of 2.0, 2.4, 2.7, and 3.0 with conventional sshEPI at TE of 22 and 35 ms. Data were acquired during a learning task which activates the medial temporal lobe bilaterally. Susceptibility related image distortion was markedly reduced with increasing SENSE acceleration. Moreover, in the group results, statistical power increased in the whole brain with SENSE compared to conventional imaging and with a TE of 35 ms compared to 22 ms. Higher SENSE acceleration factors further improved image quality and increased statistical power in the occipital lobe and fusiform gyrus, but not in the medial temporal lobe. We therefore conclude that an sshEPI acquisition protocol with a moderate SENSE acceleration factor of R = 2.0 and TE 35 ms is suitable for the detection of medial temporal activation at 3T.},

  abstract = {Signal-to-noise ratio, the ratio between signal and noise, is a quantity that has been well established for MRI data but is still subject of ongoing debate and confusion when it comes to fMRI data. fMRI data are characterised by small activation fluctuations in a background of noise. Depending on how the signal of interest and the noise are identified, signal-to-noise ratio for fMRI data is reported by using many different definitions. Since each definition comes with a different scale, interpreting and comparing signal-to-noise ratio values for fMRI data can be a very challenging job. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing definitions. Further, the relationship with activation detection power is investigated. Reference tables and conversion formulae are provided to facilitate comparability between fMRI studies.},
